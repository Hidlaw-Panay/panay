                  shelter, welfare, and the freedom to pursue his dreams for a
                  better quality of life. I miss the government that provides
                  the necessary support for quality education, promotes health
                  and well-being, provides for those who have less in life and
                  offers opportunity for the realization of one’s dream for a

                  provide given its financial resources and its internal
                  capability to implement them. It must be prioritized based on
                  its strategic value to the over-all development of the
                  municipality rather than the political mileage of the decision
                  maker. My administration as a mayor and governor have invested
                  on prioritizing the more strategic infrastructure and built
                  its internal capability to build those infrastructure projects
                  at a much lesser cost. However, in order to sustain your

                  organizations may have seen the impact of my efforts that they

                  Governor of the Philippines and the Most Outstanding Local
                  Chief Executive Awards. However, the greatest recognition that

                  realize that economic development has never been inclusive.
                  The benefits of economic growth are always enjoyed by a
                  handful of individuals who has the means, influence and the
                  power over others. Even under a free enterprise economy, I
                  always believe that government can equalize, can level the
                  playing field and can provide the necessary environment that
                  people can have equal, free and easy access to economic
                  opportunities either through direct incentives or appropriate

                  Pan-ayanon and even to the people of Capiz. In order for these
                  resources to be sustainable, we need to conserve, develop and
                  properly manage them so as to ensure food security and
                  economic prosperity for the Pan-ayanons. Apart from regulating
                  the use of these resources, government must ensure that
                  everyone has equal opportunity to benefit from these bounties
                  and must ensure that it shall not fall under the control of

                  wastes. If the established and traditional way is not
                  applicable, government must adopt creative and vigorous
                  efforts, adopt new technology and advocate to ingrain the
                  value of sustainable waste management into the culture of the
                  Pan-ayanon. The challenge that the climate change phenomena is
                  posing to our very existence are primary reasons that we all
